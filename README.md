# Convolutional Deep Neural Network for Image Classification

## AIM

To Develop a convolutional deep neural network for image classification and to verify the response for new images.

## Problem Statement and Dataset

**Problem Statement:** Build, train, and evaluate a CNN that classifies natural images into one of 10 categories. Produce training curves, a confusion matrix, a classification report, and demonstrate predictions on new images.

### Name:
### Register Number:
```python
class CNNClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CNNClassifier, self).__init__()
        # write your code here





    def forward(self, x):
        # write your code here



```

```python
# Initialize the Model, Loss Function, and Optimizer

```

```python
# Train the Model
def train_model(model, train_loader, num_epochs=3):

    # write your code here

        
        
        
        print('Name:        ')
        print('Register Number:       ')
        print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {running_loss/len(train_loader):.4f}')
